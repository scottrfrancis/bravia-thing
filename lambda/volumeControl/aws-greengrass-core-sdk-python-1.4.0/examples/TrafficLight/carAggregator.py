# This is part of the Traffic Light example and requires both LightController
# and TrafficLight GGADS to work properly.
# This also requires setup steps including permissions before it will work.
# Please refer to module 6 in Greengrass getting started guide for
# directions.
# **************************************************************************

# This example demonstrates how state can be tracked in a pinned lambda and how
# to interface with AWS,
# This lambda function will listens to shadow MQTT message on light status.
# When the light is green, it generates a random number to represent the number
# of cars that passed.
# This function stores statistics on these numbers and uploads them to DynamoDB
# on every fourth green light.
# Since this function is long-lived it will run forever when deployed to a
# Greengrass core.
